            <p class="secp2 ">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills
                deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
                imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As
                cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation,
                formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.[2]


                Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European
                civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.[4]

                In China, Confucius (551–479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most influential ancient
                philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like
                Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.  </p>

            <p class="secp1 ">Transforming Education in India</p>
            <p class="secp2 ">The Renaissance in Europe ushered in a new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry and
                appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg developed a
                printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires
                saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe.
                Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilizations – as with the Jesuit
                China missions who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture
                between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like Euclid's Elements for Chinese scholars and
                the thoughts of Confucius for European audiences. The Enlightenment saw the emergence of a more secular
                educational outlook in Europe.

                In most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or otherwise, is compulsory for all
                children up to a certain age. Due to this the proliferation of compulsory education, combined with
                population growth, UNESCO has calculated that in the next 30 years more people will receive formal
                education than in all of human history thus far. </p>

            <p class="secp1 ">Lets Grow together</p>
            <p class="secp2 ">The Aztecs also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an equivalent word
                in Nahuatl called tlacahuapahualiztli. It means "the art of raising or educating a person",[6] or "the
                art of strengthening or bringing up men".[7] This was a broad conceptualization of education, which
                prescribed that it begins at home, supported by formal schooling, and reinforced by community living.
                Historians cite that formal education was mandatory for everyone regardless of social class and
                gender.[8] There was also the word neixtlamachiliztli, which is "the act of giving wisdom to the
                face."[7] These concepts underscore a complex set of educational practices, which was oriented towards
                communicating to the next generation the experience and intellectual heritage of the past for the
                purpose of individual development and his integration into the community.[7]

                After the Fall of Rome, the Catholic Church became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western
                Europe.[9] The church established cathedral schools in the Early Middle Ages as centres of advanced
                education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into medieval universities and forebears of
                many of Europe's modern universities. </p>
